WDD 131 - Website Project: Subject

After speaking with my wife she really wants a website that she can store all of her recipes.  I thought that was funny after reading your anouncement on how you created a recipe website for your wife.  I want to create a site that will allow my wife to store all of her family recipes and allow her to make side notes on each recipe.  It will have different catagories such as main meal, dessert, side dish, snacks and others.  I want her to be able to mark recipes as favorites to make it quick to just go to a favorites page for the most used recipes.  I might want to add another page that allows you to select several recipes and create a shopping list for all the ingridents.  There should be functionality to add new recipes, remove recipes, and alter existing recipes.  I might store this information in either a json file or mysql database.  I also think it would be helpful to have some kind of search functionality to find recipes with key words or ingredients.

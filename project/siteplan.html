        <h2>Site Name:</h2>
        <h3>recipebox.com</h3>
        <p>Reason for Selection:
            This name clearly identifies the purpose of the website as a platform for managing and organizing personal
            recipes. The name is simple and directly expresses the site's primary function. It also reminds me of the
            metal recipe box my wife has sitting in her cupboard.</p>
        <h2>Site Purpose:</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this site is to provide users with a convenient way to store, organize, and search their
            personal recipe collections. Users will be able to create an account, upload and categorize recipes, tag
            ingredients, and search recipes by name or ingredient. The site will possibly feature a grocery list
            generator to make it easy to pick out at the store the items you need to make a meal or recipe. I also want
            to add a way to share recipes with other users on the site.</p>
        <h2>Scenarios:</h2>
        <h3>How can I organize my recipes by meal type or cuisine?</h3>
        <p>Visitors will find categories such as Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Desserts, and different cuisine types to
            easily organize and locate their recipes.</p>
        <h3>How can I create a grocery list based on selected recipes?</h3>
        <p>The site will allow users to select recipes and automatically generate a grocery list based on the required
            ingredients.</p>
        <h2>Color Schema:</h2>
        <p>The color scheme will focus on natural, warm colors that again remind me of my wifes physical recipe boxes.
            These colors are also some of my wifes favorite colors as she will be using this site.</p>
        <p>Primary Color: Light Sage Green (#C3D6B6) - Used for the website's background and primary menu buttons. It
            looks clean and fits well with a cooking/recipe theme.</p>
        <p>Secondary Color: Warm Terracotta (#E08D62) - Used for headings, links, and other accents throughout the site.
            This color provides a good contrast with the green background.</p>
